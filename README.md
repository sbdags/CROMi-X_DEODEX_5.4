INSTALLING CROMI-X

Steps

1.     Download the appropriate ROM package below and save to your internal or external SD Card. 
Do not unzip the file. Join the debate about which manner of packaging files is better 
([URL="http://droidxblog.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/what-is-odex-and-deodex-in-android-a-complete-guide/"]ODEX or DEODEX[/URL]) 
or just use DEODEX since it allows for a bit more customization possibilities. ODEX may boot slightly faster but then again, 
it may only boot slightly faster the first time. 
Google ODEX vs DEODEX if you really want to understand.

2.     Boot to recovery – Either choose Boot to Recovery from the Power Menu - Restart in CROMi-X or from a tablet power off hold the volume down button and press the power button. Once your see the flashing RCK icon, press volume up to select. If another icon is flashing use volume down to move between icons.  
 
3.     Using your recovery make a Nandroid Back up of your current setup
 
4.     Select install and navigate to where you saved your ROM zip file. 
 
5.     Choose the CROMi-Xenogensis zip file and follow the on screen prompts to customize your installation. 
 
6.     Reboot and enjoy.
