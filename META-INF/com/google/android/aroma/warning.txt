ABOUT DISABLING FSYNC, ENABLING OVER/UNDER VOLTING AND CACHE2SD:

Use these at your own risk! I will not be responsible for any bootlooping tablets or loss of data!

Only turn on these options if you have a working CWM/TWRP Nandroid backup and can restore that backup from recovery.

Disabling fsync removes the need for SQLite to check that data has been written to disk successfully. It also means that the operating system can freely re-order writes before they are comitted to flash memory. 
In the event of an Android freeze or hard lock resultng in a reboot, it *could* lead to database corruption which may result in data loss.

Enabling Cache2SD can cause issues if your card is not fast enough or it becomes corrupted. It is an experimental devlopment so use with caution.

Thank You. Apply them at your own risk.
